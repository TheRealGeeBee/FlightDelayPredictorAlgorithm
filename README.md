# FlightDelayPredictorAlgorithm

_Look at how much I have grown from those early days of 'Hello World' in Machine Learning!_

This algorithm employs Logistic Regression (and working with some label values) to predict whether or not a scheduled flight would be delayed.

The test areas (as can be gleaned from the dataset) appears to be largely in the North Americas. I can't wait to work with more datasets that could apply more to my immediate environment.

# More wins to me.
